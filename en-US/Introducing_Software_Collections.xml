  <para>This chapter introduces you to the packaging with &DSCL;s (&DSC;) for short.</para>
  <section id="sect-What_Are_Software_Collections">
    <title>What Are &DSCL;s</title>
    <para>With &DSCL;s, you can concurrently install multiple versions of the same software packages on your system. &DSCL;s do not affect the system versions of the packages installed by the conventional RPM package manager.

        <listitem>
          <para>&DSCL;s are distributed as a set of several components, which provide their full functionality without overwriting system files.

  <section id="sect-File_System_Hierarchy">
    <title>File System Hierarchy</title>
    <para>The root directory of the &DSCL;s is typically located in the <filename>/&OPT;/</filename> directory to avoid possible conflicts between the &DSCL;s and the base system installation.</para>
    <para>You can change the location of the root directory by setting the %_scl_prefix macro in the spec file.</para>
    <para>Below is a typical layout of the file system hierarchy with two &DSCL;s, <replaceable>&DSCL; 1</replaceable> and <replaceable>&DSCL; 2</replaceable>:</para>
    <programlisting><replaceable>&OPT;</replaceable>
`-- <replaceable>&RH;</replaceable>
    |-- &DSCL; 1
    |   `-- <replaceable>architecture</replaceable>
    |       |-- &DSCL; root directory
    |       `-- &DSCL; scriptlets

    `-- &DSCL; 2
        `-- <replaceable>architecture</replaceable>

            `-- &DSCL; scriptlets

    <!--FIXME: What are SC scriptlets, reference them.-->
    <para>For more information on the &DSCL; scriptlets, refer to <xref linkend="sect-Software_Collection_Scriptlets"/>.</para>
  </section>
  <section id="sect-Software_Collection_Scriptlets">
    <title>&DSCL; Scriptlets</title>
    <para>The &DSCL; scriptlets are simple shell scripts that change the current system environment so that the group of packages in the &DSCL; is preferred over the corresponding group of conventional packages installed on the system.</para>
    <para>To utilize the &DSCL; scriptlets, use the <application>scl</application> tool. For more information on <application>scl</application>, refer to <xref linkend="sect-Enabling_the_Software_Collection"/>.</para>
  </section>
  <section id="sect-Package_Layout">
    <title>Package Layout</title>
    <para>The &DSCL; layout consists of the meta package, which installs a subset of other packages, and a number of the &DSCL; packages, which are installed within the &DSCL; namespace.</para>
    <section id="sect-Meta_Package">
      <title>Meta Package</title>
      <para>
		Each &DSCL; includes a meta package, which installs essential, minimal subset of packages. For example, it can provide the Perl language interpreter, but no Perl extension modules. The &DSCL; also contains a basic file system hierarchy and ships a number of &DSCL; scriptlets. The purpose of the meta package is to make sure that all essential packages in the &DSCL; are properly installed and that it is possible to enable the &DSCL;.</para>
      <para>The meta package produces the following packages that are part of the &DSCL;:</para>
      <variablelist>
        <varlistentry>
          <term>The main package: %{scl_prefix}%scl</term>
          <listitem>
            <para>The main package in the &DSCL; contains dependencies of the base packages, which are included in the &DSCL;. The main package contains no files.</para>
            <para>For example, the main package macro is expanded to:</para>
            <programlisting>scl_core</programlisting>
            <para>where <literal>core</literal> is the name of the &DSCL;.</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
        <varlistentry>
          <term>The runtime subpackage: scl_<replaceable>name</replaceable>-runtime</term>
          <listitem>
            <para>The runtime subpackage in the &DSCL; owns the &DSCL; file system and ships the &DSCL; scriptlets.</para>
            <para>For example, the runtime subpackage macro is expanded to:</para>
            <programlisting>scl_core-runtime</programlisting>
            <para>where <literal>core</literal> is the name of the &DSCL;.</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
        <varlistentry>
          <term>The build subpackage: scl_<replaceable>name</replaceable>-build</term>
          <listitem>
            <para>The build subpackage in the &DSCL; ships the &DSCL; build configuration. The build subpackage is optional can be excluded from the &DSCL;.</para>
            <para>For example, the build subpackage macro is expanded to:</para>
            <programlisting>scl_core-build</programlisting>
            <para>where <literal>core</literal> is the name of the &DSCL;.</para>

      <para>Besides the minimal subset of packages installed by the meta package, the &DSCL; also installs a number of packages that are part of the package collection itself.</para>

    <title>Enabling a &DSCL;</title>
    <para>The <application>scl</application> tool is used to enable a &DSCL; and to run programs in the &DSCL; environment.</para>
    <para>General usage of the <application>scl</application> tool can be described using the following syntax:</para>
    <synopsis>
      <command>scl</command>
      <replaceable>action</replaceable>
      <replaceable>software_collection_1</replaceable>
      <replaceable>software_collection_2</replaceable>
      <replaceable>command</replaceable>
    </synopsis>
    <para>For example, use the following command to execute <command>ruby --version</command> in the &DSCL; environment:</para>
    <synopsis>
      <command>scl enable ruby_1.8.7 'ruby --version'</command>
    </synopsis>
    <para>where <literal>ruby_1.8.7</literal> is the name of the &DSCL;. With this command, the <application>ruby</application> program, which is provided by one of the packages in the &DSCL;, is run in an environment that is completely separated from the system one.</para>
    <para>With <application>scl</application>, you can also run a program in the separated environment with multiple &DSCL;s enabled. For example, to run the <application>bash</application> shell with the <literal>rails_3.2</literal> and <literal>postgresql_8.2</literal> &DSCL;s, execute the following command:</para>
    <synopsis>
      <command>scl enable rails_3.2 postgresql_8.2 bash</command>
    </synopsis>
    <para>In the separated environment, it is also possible to execute a list of commands that is, for example, included in a file. You can run the following command to get the commands from the <filename>cmd</filename> file and execute these commands in the separated environment:</para>
    <synopsis>
      <command>cat cmd | scl enable core -</command>
    </synopsis>
    <para>where <literal>core</literal> is the name of the &DSCL;.</para>
